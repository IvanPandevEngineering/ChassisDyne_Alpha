HIGH PRIORITY
- add road surface functionality back in
    - should inputs_dt be a dict or named tuple?
X remove hysteresis as defined currently
- refactor where all params of interest are calculated

LOW PRIORITY
- labeled axes on printouts
- multiple plotting functions for either G-replay or Shaker Rig
- separate plotting file
- create one G = 9.80655 global variable in functions.py and otherwise

POTENTIAL TASKS
- command line actions
- simple GUI
